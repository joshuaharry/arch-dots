# Arch Linux Dotfiles

These dotfiles configure a System 76 Linux laptop to work with Arch Linux.
They set up:

- `zsh` with all of the plugins that I like
- `neovim` with a suite of plugins that I like
- `dwm` with a custom build including gaps
- `pybar` - a custom status bar that shows the current battery,
  brightness, weather, and volume

## Motivation

I've been tinkering with Linux for about a decade. My best friend put Linux
on my laptop my freshman year, when I was 18, and I went on a quest to make
my computer usable without ever touching the mouse. From there, I tried every
Linux distribution under the sun, including:

- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Arch Linux
- Void Linux
- Gentoo
- Nix OS

I used every editor I could find, including:

- Atom
- Vim
- Emacs
- Neovim

I tried all the popular shells:

- Bash
- Zsh
- Fish

I started with the popular desktop environments...

- Gnome
- KDE

Before hacking on every tiling window manager I could find:

- i3
- XMonad
- Awesome WM
- BSPWM
- qtile
- dwm
- Exwm
- Spectrwm

Along the way, I learned how to program a bit of Python, Lua, Haskell, LISP,
and C. I spent years tinkering and experimenting, occassionally writing essays
with LaTeX instead of Google Docs or Word; I went on side quests to make my
computer use less than 500MB of memory at all times. I loved seeing what I
could make my computer do for no other reason than that I enjoyed doing it.

At the end of that journey of tinkering and play, even though I had never
taken a computer science class as an undergraduate, I knew how to program.
